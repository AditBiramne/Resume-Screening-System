Save the project in this format.

Once the files are saved correctly, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and navigate to the Resume directory. Open the app.py file in VS Code and then open a terminal within VS Code (using Ctrl + or via the Terminal menu). Ensure you are in the Resume directory within the terminal, then run the Flask application by executing python app.py. Flask will start the server and provide a local URL, typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Navigate to this URL in your web browser to access and interact with the project.
